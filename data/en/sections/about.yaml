# a summary about you
summary: "I am looking for a new challenge in a job
 that will allow me to grow. With the assistance of my studies, 
 I have gained remarkable programming abilities as well as broad understanding 
 of general and medical-specific computer science. My horizon now is wide open. 
 I foresee myself either working on Full-Stack solutions, creating and integrating machine learning 
 solutions into applications, digitizing and optimising 
 business processes, or doing all of the above. Along with my 10 years of experience 
 in biology research labs and my new abilities in software development, 
 I wish to apply what I've learned in new exciting projects."
